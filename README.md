# BikeShare_SQL_Case_Study
This project is an SQL case study simulating a bike sharing system.
It demonstrates how SQL (MySQL) can be used to analyze and extract insights from operational data using CTEs, aggregations, joins, and window functions.

**Project Structure**
Bikeshare_CreateDB.sql
  This script contains all SQL statements needed to create and populate the database.

Bikeshare_Queries.sql
  This script contains 10 analytical SQL queries built with Common Table Expressions (CTEs).
  Each query addresses a realistic business or operational question about the bike sharing system.
  Each query is cleanly formatted and commented â€” ideal for inclusion in a data analytics or SQL portfolio.

**Project Purpose**
  This case study was designed to:
    a) Practice SQL in a real-world scenario
    b) Demonstrate proficiency with CTEs, aggregations, window functions, and ranking queries
    c) Build a solid SQL portfolio project showcasing analytical thinking and query design
